    as we avoid certain characters that would conflict:

    - Newlines (which of course separate CSV entries)
    - Tabs (which separate our columns)
    - Null codepoints (which are not allowed in psql)

    We also need to escape every literal backslash, as backslashes are
    interpreted by psql.

    It's a good question whether this step should be necessary -- names
    of concepts shouldn't include control characters, and the few
    instances of backslashes in ConceptNet appear to be mistakes.

# This file is an example of a "blocklist", used to keep bad or offensive
# data out of ConceptNet. We don't want to use the real blocklist in test
# cases, for good reasons, so here is a blocklist made of silly examples
# instead.

# Examples of things that can be blocked include:
#
# Specific unreliable statements
/a/[/r/MadeOf/,/c/en/moon/,/c/en/green_cheese/]

# Poisonous concepts that should be relegated to the past
/c/en/mapreduce

# Bad words with many derived forms
DERIVED /c/en/heck

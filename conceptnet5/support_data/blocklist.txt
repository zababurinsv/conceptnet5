# Any assertion that matches a line of this file will be excluded from the
# ConceptNet build. There are also special keywords such as 'DERIVED' that
# will follow DerivedFrom links and exclude those words as well.
#
# If you see things that should be added to or removed from the list,
# probably the most useful way would be a private e-mail to me as the
# maintainer of ConceptNet (see the README). I believe it would be
# counterproductive to use a GitHub issue for this purpose.

# Slurs that should not be included in ConceptNet, no matter the source.
# These words are offensive in the majority of their usage, so we don't want

# I had to skim a lot of poorly-labeled crud in Wiktionary to get most of this
# list, and I found it in the database export in roughly the order it was added
# to Wiktionary, and I got tired of this and stopped at some point, so I'm sorry
# for whatever I missed.

# Some slurs have a startling number of terms derived from them in Wiktionary,
# and there's no markup to label a term in the 'Derived terms' list as offensive.
# So these rules will propagate across DerivedFrom relations, adding any derived
# term in Wiktionary to the blocklist.

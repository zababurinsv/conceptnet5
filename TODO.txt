For ConceptNet 5.6.x:

- [ ] Remove the massive cluster of French communes
- [ ] Higher weights on monolingual things, lower weights on uncommon languages
- [ ] Add a page listing languages
- [ ] Add a page per language
- [ ] Nodes should have labels that are stored separately from their edges
- [ ] Relabel vague nodes like "someone" and "something"
- [ ] Infer things from verb phrases
- [ ] DBPedia relations can be cleaned up; for example, with some gerund to noun
      mapping, we can turn "occupation" into "InstanceOf" or "IsA"
- [ ] Drop the DBPedia 'leader' relation, it's underused and very time-dependent
